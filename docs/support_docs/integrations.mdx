## Stripe Connect Integration

Accept payments for products and services with Stripe's payment infrastructure.

**Stripe Connect** allows you to accept payments through Vibey while maintaining your own Stripe account and full control over funds.

### What You Can Do

- **Collect one-time payments** - Products, services, digital downloads
- **Set up recurring subscriptions** - Monthly, yearly, custom billing cycles
- **Offer payment plans** - Split payments over time

- **Manage customer portal** - Customers manage their subscriptions
- **Handle refunds** - Full or partial refunds directly from Vibey
- **Accept multiple payment methods** - Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, ACH (coming soon)

### How Stripe Connect Works

**Traditional Stripe:**

**Stripe Connect (What Vibey Uses):**

- Funds go directly to your bank account
- Vibey facilitates payment but doesn't touch money
- Lower fees (no middleman)

### Tag-Based Automation Ideas

Use Vibey tags to trigger powerful GHL workflows:

**Lead Scoring:**
- Vibey detects engaged lead (multiple pages viewed) → Applies "Hot Lead" tag → GHL workflow notifies sales rep

**Segmentation:**
- Vibey funnel determines interest (clicked "SaaS" vs "Agency") → Applies category tag → GHL sends relevant content

**Re-Engagement:**
- Vibey detects abandoned funnel → Applies "Abandoned" tag → GHL triggers win-back sequence

**Upsell/Cross-Sell:**
- Vibey payment received → Applies "Customer" tag → GHL removes from prospect workflows, adds to customer onboarding

---

### Two-Way Sync

Changes in GHL reflect back in Vibey (if enabled).

**Use Cases:**

**Scenario 1:** Sales rep updates contact phone in GHL
- Change syncs to Vibey within 5 minutes
- Vibey sequences now use updated phone number

**Scenario 2:** GHL workflow applies "Qualified" tag
- Tag appears in Vibey automatically
- Vibey can show different funnel content based on tag

**Scenario 3:** Contact unsubscribes in GHL
- Vibey respects unsubscribe status
- Won't send emails from Vibey sequences

**Enable Two-Way Sync:**
- Settings > Integrations > GoHighLevel > **Enable Two-Way Sync**
- Choose sync frequency: Real-time (5min), Hourly, or Daily

## Managing Integrations

### Connection Status

View all integrations at a glance.

**Status Types:**
- **Connected** (green) - Working properly
- **Error** (red) - Connection failed, needs attention
- **Pending** (yellow) - Awaiting authorization
- **Disconnected** (gray) - Not connected

### Reconnecting

If integration breaks:

1. Settings > **Integrations**
2. Find broken integration (red status)
3. Click **Reconnect**
4. Re-authorize
5. Test connection

**Common Causes:**
- Token expired (re-auth fixes it)
- Account permissions changed
- Service downtime

### Disconnecting

Remove integration completely.

1. Settings > **Integrations**
2. Select integration
3. Click **Disconnect**
4. Confirm

**What Happens:**

- Past synced data remains in both platforms
- Can reconnect anytime

---

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Syncing

**Check:**
- Integration status = Connected
- Event configured correctly
- Test data to verify
- API limits not exceeded

**Fix:**
1. Reconnect integration
2. Check integration settings
3. Send test event
4. Contact support if persists

### Duplicate Records

**Cause:** Same lead synced multiple times

**Fix (Airtable):**
- Use email as unique identifier
- Enable duplicate detection in Airtable
- Manual merge if needed

**Fix (GHL):**
- GHL auto-merges by email
- Check merge rules in GHL settings

---

## Best Practices

### Use Webhooks for Real-Time

For time-sensitive actions, use webhooks (instant delivery).

For bulk operations, use scheduled syncs.

### Map Fields Carefully

Ensure data goes to correct fields.

**Before Activating:**
- Test with sample lead
- Verify all fields populated correctly
- Check date formats match

### Monitor Connection Health

Weekly check on integration status.

**If Error:**
- Reconnect immediately
- Don't let data queue up
- Fix before large campaign
