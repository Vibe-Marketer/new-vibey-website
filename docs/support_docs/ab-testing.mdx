# A/B Testing

<Info>
**Coming in Q3 2026** - A/B testing features are currently in development.
</Info>

Test multiple versions of your funnels to discover what converts best. Split traffic automatically, track performance, and let data decide the winner.

## What's Coming

### Funnel A/B Testing

Test different funnel variations head-to-head.

**What You Can Test:**
- **Headlines** - Which headline drives more conversions?
- **Copy** - Long-form vs short-form
- **CTAs** - "Get Started" vs "Try Free" vs "Buy Now"
- **Images** - Hero image A vs B
- **Layouts** - Single column vs two column
- **Colors** - Button colors, backgrounds
- **Entire Pages** - Completely different page designs

**How It Works:**
1. Create funnel (Version A)
2. Duplicate and modify (Version B)
3. Set traffic split (50/50, 70/30, etc.)
4. Publish test
5. Vibey automatically splits traffic
6. Monitor results in real-time
7. Declare winner when statistically significant
8. Winner becomes default (100% traffic)

### Email A/B Testing

Test email subject lines, content, and send times.

**Test Types:**
- **Subject Line** - Test up to 5 subject lines
- **Preview Text** - What shows in inbox preview
- **Sender Name** - Personal name vs company name
- **Send Time** - Morning vs afternoon vs evening
- **Email Content** - Different body copy, images, CTAs

**How It Works:**
1. Create email in sequence
2. Add variations (A, B, C, D, E)
3. Set test size (send to 20% of list)
4. Winner determined after 4 hours
5. Winning version sent to remaining 80%

**Result:**
- Higher open rates
- Better click-through
- More conversions

---

### Campaign A/B Testing

Test entire campaign flows.

**What You Can Test:**
- **Sequence Timing** - Aggressive vs nurture pace
- **Sequence Length** - 3 emails vs 7 emails
- **Funnel Entry Point** - Lead magnet A vs lead magnet B
- **Offer Positioning** - Different messaging angles

**How It Works:**
1. Create campaign (Version A)
2. Clone campaign, modify (Version B)
3. Split new leads 50/50 between campaigns
4. Track conversion rate to final goal
5. Winner = highest conversion rate

---

### What Gets Measured

**Funnel Tests:**
- Page views
- Bounce rate
- Time on page
- Form submissions
- Conversion rate (opt-in, purchase, etc.)
- Revenue per visitor (if payments enabled)

**Email Tests:**
- Open rate
- Click rate
- Reply rate
- Unsubscribe rate
- Conversion rate (link clicks to goal completion)

**Campaign Tests:**
- Lead-to-customer conversion rate
- Revenue per lead
- Cost per acquisition (if ad spend tracked)
- Time to conversion
- Lifetime value (LTV)

### Statistical Significance

Vibey automatically calculates when a winner is clear.

**What Is Statistical Significance?**
- Confidence that results aren't random chance
- 95% confidence = standard (5% chance of fluke)
- Vibey won't declare winner until significant

**Variables:**
- Sample size (more traffic = faster significance)
- Difference between variations (bigger gap = faster)
- Baseline conversion rate

**Example:**
- Variant A: 5% conversion (100 visitors, 5 conversions)
- Variant B: 10% conversion (100 visitors, 10 conversions)
- Statistical significance: 98% (clear winner = B)

**Vibey Shows:**
- Current significance level (e.g., 78%)
- Estimated time to significance
- Recommendation: Keep running or declare winner

---

### Multivariate Testing

Test multiple elements simultaneously.

**Example:**
- Test 3 headlines × 2 CTAs × 2 images = 12 combinations
- Vibey shows which combination performs best
- Discover interaction effects (headline A works best with CTA B)

**Use Case:**
- High-traffic funnels (need volume for multivariate)
- Fine-tuning already-good funnels
- Advanced optimization

**Requirements:**
- High traffic volume (500+ visitors/day recommended)
- Longer test duration
- Pro plan with A/B testing add-on

---

### Auto-Optimize Mode

Let Vibey automatically choose winners.

**How It Works:**
1. Create multiple variations
2. Enable **Auto-Optimize**
3. Vibey starts with even split
4. Gradually shifts traffic to better performers
5. Eventually 100% traffic goes to winner

**Benefits:**
- Maximize conversions during test (not after)
- No need to manually declare winner
- Continuously optimizes

**Use Case:**
- Long-running evergreen funnels
- Don't want to monitor tests manually

## Questions?

**Q: When exactly in Q3 2026?**

A: Tentatively August 2026. Join waitlist for updates.

A: Yes. Pro plan supports up to 5 variations. Advanced add-on supports unlimited.

**Q: How much traffic do I need for reliable results?**

A: Minimum 100 conversions per variant recommended. Less traffic = longer test duration.

**Q: Will tests slow down my site?**

A: No. A/B testing runs server-side (no performance impact).

**Q: Can I stop a test early?**

A: Yes, but not recommended unless you have statistical significance. Stopping early = unreliable results.
