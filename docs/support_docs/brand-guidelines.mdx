## Typography

Fonts for headlines, body copy, and accents.

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Your "voice" font. Bold, attention-grabbing.

**AI Considers:**
- Your market positioning (premium vs. accessible)
- Target audience (corporate vs. creative)
- Industry norms

**Example Output:**
```
Primary Font: Inter Bold
Use for: Main headlines, page titles, CTAs
Weight: 700
```

### Secondary Font (Body)

Readable, clean, professional.

**AI Considers:**
- Readability on screens
- Pairing with primary font
- Web availability

**Example Output:**
```
Secondary Font: Inter Regular
Use for: Body copy, paragraphs, descriptions
Weight: 400
```

### Accent Font (Optional)

Special touches, quotes, highlights.

**Example Output:**
```
Accent Font: Inter Italic
Use for: Pull quotes, testimonials, emphasis
Weight: 400 Italic
```

### Font Pairing

AI ensures fonts work together.

**Good Pairing:**
- Contrasting but complementary
- Different personalities
- Consistent style (modern, classic, playful)

**What Vibey Avoids:**
- Too-similar fonts (no point)
- Clashing styles (Comic Sans + Times New Roman)
- Unreadable combinations

## Color Palette

Colors that represent your brand.

### Primary Color

Your signature color. Most visible, most used.

**AI Considers:**
- Industry conventions (finance = blue, eco = green)
- Emotional associations (red = urgency, blue = trust)
- Your offer positioning

**Example Output:**
```
Primary Color: #D9FC67 (Lime Green)
Use for: CTAs, links, highlights, brand moments
Emotion: Energy, action, forward-moving
```

### Secondary Color

Supporting color. Balances primary.

**Example Output:**
```
Secondary Color: #202020 (Near Black)
Use for: Text, backgrounds, structure
Emotion: Professional, grounded, serious
```

### Accent Colors

Additional colors for variety.

**Example Output:**
```
Accent 1: #FAF9F6 (Warm White)
Use for: Backgrounds, cards, sections

Accent 2: #FF6B6B (Coral Red)
Use for: Alerts, urgent CTAs, error states
```

### Color Psychology

AI matches colors to your message.

| Color | Emotion | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Blue | Trust, stability | Finance, healthcare, B2B |
| Green | Growth, health | Wellness, eco, finance |
| Red | Urgency, passion | Sales, food, energy |
| Orange | Friendly, creative | Creative, youth, food |
| Purple | Luxury, creative | Beauty, creative, premium |
| Black | Luxury, power | Fashion, luxury, premium |
| Yellow | Optimism, clarity | Energy, children, clarity |

## Voice & Tone

How you sound in writing.

### Voice

Your personality. Consistent across everything.

**AI Generates:**
- Core voice attributes (direct, confident, friendly)

**Example Output:**
```
Voice Attributes:

Use These Words:
- Build, create, launch, ship
- Fast, simple, clear, works
- Here's, let's, you'll

Avoid These Words:
- Leverage, synergy, solution
- Amazing, incredible, revolutionary
- We believe, we think, maybe
```

### Tone Variations

Voice stays same, tone changes by context.

**Excited User:**
- Match their energy
- Use exclamation points
- Focus enthusiasm

**Frustrated User:**
- Calm, reassuring
- Solve immediately
- Empathy first

**Confused User:**
- Simple language
- Step-by-step
- Patient guidance

**Example Output:**
```
Tone for Landing Pages: Bold, confident, compelling
Tone for Errors: Helpful, clear, reassuring
Tone for Confirmation: Warm, encouraging, clear
```

## Tips for Great Brand Guidelines

### Start With Offer

Your brand flows from your positioning.

**Strong Offer = Strong Brand**
- Clear positioning → clear visual identity
- Defined audience → appropriate tone
- Unique value → distinctive aesthetic

### Don't Overthink It

Your first brand doesn't have to be perfect.

**Iterate:**
1. Generate guidelines
2. Use them in funnels
3. See what works
4. Adjust as needed

### Stay Consistent

Consistency > perfection.

**Better:**
- "Good enough" brand used consistently
- Customers recognize you immediately
- Trust builds over time

**Worse:**
- Perfect brand used inconsistently
- Customers confused by inconsistency
- No brand recognition

### Get Feedback

Show brand guidelines to others:
- Does it match how you position yourself?
- Is the tone appropriate for your market?
- Do colors and fonts feel right?

Outside perspective helps catch misalignments.
