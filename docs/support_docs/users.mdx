## Current User Model

Right now, VibeOS operates on a **single-user account** model.

- One account per subscription
- One login per account
- All offers, funnels, and leads owned by account holder

### Sharing Access Workaround

Until team features launch, here's how teams are handling collaboration:

**Option 1: Shared Login (Not Recommended)**
- Share login credentials with team members
- Risk: No activity tracking, security concerns
- Use a password manager if you choose this route

**Option 2: Export & Share (Recommended)**
- Export offer documents as DOCX
- Share funnel preview links (read-only)
- Use external tools (Notion, Google Docs) for collaboration

**Option 3: Screen Share**
- Use Zoom, Loom, or similar for walkthrough
- Record funnel building sessions
- Great for client approvals

## Roles & Permissions (Coming Q1 2026)

When team features launch, here's what each role will do:

### Owner

Full access. Only one owner per account.

- Manage billing and subscription
- Add/remove team members
- Access all features
- Delete account
- Transfer ownership

### Admin

Almost full access. Multiple admins allowed.

- Create and edit offers, funnels, brand guidelines
- Manage integrations
- View analytics
- Add/remove team members (except owner)
- Cannot manage billing or delete account

### Editor

Build and publish. No account management.

- Create and edit offers and funnels
- Publish funnels (within plan limits)
- Upload to media library
- View leads and analytics
- Cannot manage team, billing, or integrations

### Viewer

Read-only access.

- View offers, funnels, and brand guidelines
- View analytics and leads
- Export data
- Cannot create, edit, or publish anything

## Workspace Management (Coming Q1 2026)

Agencies and consultants will be able to create separate workspaces.

### How Workspaces Work

- **One workspace per client** - Keep projects separate
- **Separate billing** - Each workspace billed independently or rolled into agency plan
- **Isolated data** - Offers, funnels, and leads don't cross workspaces
- **Easy switching** - Toggle between workspaces in navbar

### Agency Plans

We're designing special agency pricing:

- Unlimited workspaces
- White-label mode (remove Vibey branding)
- Client portal access
- Priority support

## Activity Logs (Coming Q1 2026)

Track everything your team does.

### What's Logged

- Offer created/edited/deleted
- Funnel published/unpublished
- Domain added/verified
- Integration connected/disconnected
- Team member added/removed
- Brand guidelines generated

### Log Details

Each entry shows:
- Who did it (team member name)
- What they did (action)
- When it happened (timestamp)
- Where it happened (specific offer/funnel ID)

Export logs as CSV for compliance or auditing.

## Current Workarounds for Teams

Until team features are live, here's what works:

### For Agencies

Create one account per client. Each account has its own:
- Login credentials
- Subscription (Free or Pro)
- Offers, funnels, domains
- Media library

**Cost:** $147/month per client (Pro) or Free tier if they qualify

### For In-House Teams

**Small Teams (2-3 people):**
- Use shared login with password manager
- Document who's working on what externally
- Use Slack or project management tool for coordination

**Larger Teams (4+ people):**
- Wait for team features (Q1 2026)
- Use export features to share work
- Assign one person as "Vibey admin" who builds everything

## Inviting Team Members (Q1 2026)

When this launches, here's how it works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Team Settings">
    Settings > **Team** > **Invite Member**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Email and Role">
    Type their email. Choose role (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    They receive email invite. They create account or link existing account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="They Accept">
    Once accepted, they appear in your team list. Start collaborating.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Team Members

Settings > **Team** > Select member > **Remove**

- They lose access immediately
- Their work stays in your account
- Reactivate by sending new invite

## Permissions Matrix (Future)

| Feature | Owner | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Manage billing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Security Best Practices

Until team features launch:

### If Sharing Login

- Use strong, unique password (not reused from other services)
- Enable 2FA (coming soon)
- Use password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Change password when team member leaves
- Don't share credentials via email or Slack

### Alternative: Screen Recording

- Record yourself building in Vibey
- Share Loom/Zoom videos with team
- They provide feedback via comments
- You implement changes
- Slower, but more secure
