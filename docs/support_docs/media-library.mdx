---

### Tag Everything

Tags are faster than browsing folders.

---

### Clean Up Regularly

Monthly maintenance keeps library organized.

**Monthly Checklist:**
- [ ] Delete unused files
- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Rename unclear files
- [ ] Archive old campaign assets

---

### Folder Structure by Campaign

Organize by project/campaign, not file type.

**Good Structure:**
```
├── Launch Jan 2025
│   ├── Landing Page Assets
│   ├── Email Images
│   └── Social Media
├── Webinar Feb 2025
└── Evergreen Assets
    ├── Logos
    └── Brand Images
```

**Bad Structure:**
```
├── All Images
├── All Videos
└── All Documents
```

**Why:** Easier to find campaign-specific assets

---
