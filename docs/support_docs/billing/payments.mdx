## Payment Best Practices

### Keep Your Card Updated

Set calendar reminder 1 month before card expires. Update before expiration to avoid service interruption.

### Use Backup Payment Method

Add secondary card to automatically charge if primary fails.

**To Add Backup:**
1. Add second payment method
2. It stays on file as backup
3. Auto-charged if primary fails

### Monitor Billing Emails

Always read billing emails. They contain:
- Upcoming charge notices (3 days before)
- Successful payment confirmations
- Failed payment alerts

### Check Bank for Declines

If payment fails, check with your bank:
- Is card active?
- Sufficient funds?
- Is recurring billing enabled?
- Is international billing blocked?
