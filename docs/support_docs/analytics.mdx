## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Tracking

**Check:**
- Funnel published and live
- Tracking script present (automatic)
- Not using ad blocker (test in incognito)
- Browser cookies enabled (for third-party pixels only)

**Fix:**
1. Republish funnel
2. Clear cache
3. Test with different browser
4. Contact support if persists

---

### Conversions Not Recording

**Check:**
- Form connected to CRM
- Test submission yourself
- Check spam folder for confirmation email

**Fix:**
1. Submit test lead
2. Verify in CRM
3. Check analytics for test conversion

---

### Traffic Source Shows "Direct"

**Cause:** UTM parameters missing or referrer stripped

**Fix:**
- Always use UTM parameters for paid traffic
- Some platforms strip referrers (expected)
- Use campaign links with UTMs
