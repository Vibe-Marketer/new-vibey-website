# Offers

Build comprehensive offer documents with AI. The 6-step wizard analyzes your product, market, and competitors to create positioning that converts.

## What Is an Offer Document?

Your offer document is the foundation of all your marketing. It contains:

- **Power Offer Statement** - Your core positioning
- **Buyer Persona** - Demographics, psychographics, pain points, desires
- **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** - Who you serve best
- **Competitive Edge** - What makes you different
- **Market Analysis** - Insights from your competitors
- **Product Details** - Features, benefits, pricing

Everything else—funnels, copy, brand—builds from this.

## The 6-Step Offer Wizard

### Step 1: Get Started

**What You'll Do:**
- Name your offer
- Add your product/service URL
- Add competitor URLs (optional but recommended)

**What Vibey Does:**
- Scrapes all URLs using Firecrawl
- Extracts product details, pricing, positioning
- Analyzes competitor messaging and offers

**Pro Tip:** Include 2-3 competitor URLs. Better competitive intel = better positioning.

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 2: Product & Market

**What You'll Do:**
- Describe your product/service
- Explain what problem it solves
- Define your target market
- Add any unique features or benefits

**What Vibey Does:**
- AI analyzes your input combined with scraped data
- Identifies market opportunities
- Spots positioning gaps vs competitors

**Pro Tip:** Be specific. Instead of "I help people get fit," try "I help busy executives lose 20 lbs in 90 days without going to the gym."

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

### Step 3: Power Offer

**What You'll Do:**
- Review AI-generated power offer statement
- Edit if needed (or regenerate)
- Optionally record voice notes about your offer

**What Vibey Does:**
- Creates your core positioning statement
- Distills everything into one clear message
- Uses proven positioning frameworks

**Example Output:**
> "We help B2B SaaS founders create 90 days of marketing assets in one click—no marketing team, no design skills, no development needed."

**Pro Tip:** Voice recording works better than typing. Just talk through your offer like you're explaining it to a friend.

**Time:** 5-7 minutes

---

### Step 4: Buyer Persona

**What You'll Do:**
- Review AI-generated buyer persona
- Add details Vibey might have missed
- Confirm or adjust demographics and psychographics

**What Vibey Does:**
- Creates detailed buyer persona based on your offer

- Defines psychographics (values, fears, desires, frustrations)
- Identifies pain points and goals

**Example Output:**
```
Name: Marketing Mike

Goals:

```

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

### Step 5: ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**What You'll Do:**

- Refine targeting criteria

**What Vibey Does:**

- Helps you say "no" to bad-fit customers

**Example Output:**
```
Company Type: B2B SaaS
Company Size: 50-500 employees
Revenue: $5M-$50M ARR
Industry: Software, Technology, Professional Services

```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 6: Competitive Edge

**What You'll Do:**
- Review competitive analysis
- Confirm your unique advantages
- Edit or add differentiators

- Creates differentiation strategy

**Example Output:**
```
What Competitors Do:

## Tips for Better Offers

### Use Competitor URLs

The more competitor data Vibey has, the better your positioning.

**Where to Find Competitor URLs:**
- Sales pages
- Pricing pages
- Landing pages
- Product pages
- About pages

**Don't Use:**
- Blog posts
- Social media profiles
- Generic "Home" pages

### Be Specific

Generic input = generic output.

**Bad:** "I help people with marketing"  
**Good:** "I help B2B SaaS founders with &lt;$5M ARR create 90 days of marketing assets in 30 minutes"

### Use Voice Recording

Talking is faster than typing. Plus, your natural language gives Vibey better context.

**Pro Tip:** Pretend you're explaining your offer to someone who's never heard of it. What would you say?

### Iterate

First draft doesn't have to be perfect. Generate → Review → Edit → Regenerate.

Each regeneration uses all your edits as additional context.
