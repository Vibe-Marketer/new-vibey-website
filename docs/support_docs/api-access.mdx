## Authentication

### API Keys

Create API keys in dashboard.

**How to Create:**
1. Settings > **API Access**
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Name the key (e.g., "Production App")
4. Copy key (shown once, can't retrieve later)
5. Use in `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header

**Best Practices:**
- One key per application
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Never commit keys to version control
- Store in environment variables
- Delete unused keys

---

### OAuth 2.0

For third-party integrations.

**Use Case:**
- Building a Vibey integration for your SaaS product
- Users authorize your app to access their Vibey account

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect Vibey"
2. Redirect to Vibey OAuth page
3. User grants permission
4. Vibey redirects back with authorization code
5. Exchange code for access token
6. Use token to make API requests
