# Quickstart Guide

Get your first offer and funnel live in 30 minutes.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- A complete offer document with buyer personas and ICP
- Brand guidelines with colors, fonts, and voice
- A published funnel with AI-generated copy
- A custom domain connected (optional)

## Step 1: Create Your Offer

The offer is your foundation. Everything else builds from it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Offer Wizard">
    Log into VibeOS. Click **Create New Offer**. You'll go through 6 steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Started">
    Name your offer. Add your product URL and any competitor URLs. Vibey will scrape these to understand your market.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Product & Market">
    Describe your product. Who's it for? What problem does it solve? The more specific, the better.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Power Offer">
    AI analyzes everything you've provided. Creates your power offer statement. This is your positioning.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buyer Persona">
    AI builds your ideal customer profile. Demographics, psychographics, pain points, desires.
  </Step>

  <Step title="ICP & Competitive Edge">
    Final step. AI identifies your competitive advantages and refines your ICP.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**Pro Tip:** Have your product/service URL ready. If you have competitor URLs, add them. Better input = better output.

## Step 2: Generate Brand Guidelines

Your offer is done. Now create your brand.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Brand Guidelines">
    From your dashboard, click **Brand Guidelines** or go to the Branding section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Guidelines">
    Click **Generate Brand Guidelines**. Select the offer you just created. AI will create your brand identity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Your Brand">
    You'll get typography, color palette, voice and tone guidelines, and visual style. Customize if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time:** 3-5 minutes
**Pro Tip:** Your brand is automatically applied to all funnels. You can customize later if you want.

## Step 3: Build Your First Funnel

Now the fun part. Build your funnel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Funnel">
    Click **Create New Funnel**. Choose your funnel type:
    - **Lead Magnet** - Capture leads with free content
    - **Webinar** - Registration and replay pages
    - **Call Booking** - Pre-qualify and schedule calls
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Your Template">
    Choose a template for each page. We have templates for opt-in pages, confirmation pages, thank you pages, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Copy">
    Click **Generate Copy**. AI pulls from your offer and brand to write conversion-focused copy. Edit what you need.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize (Optional)">
    Use the visual editor to adjust layout, colors, images. Everything autosaves.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Publish**. Your funnel goes live on a Vibey subdomain (like `yourname.vibeos.com`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**Pro Tip:** Start with a Lead Magnet funnel. Simplest way to test the platform.

## Step 4: Connect Your Domain (Optional)

Want to use your own domain? Here's how.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    Go to **Settings > Domains**. Click **Add Domain**. Enter your domain (like `example.com`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Vibey shows you exactly what DNS records to add. Go to your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) and add them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Come back to Vibey. Click **Verify**. DNS propagation takes 5-60 minutes. We'll check automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set as Primary">
    Once verified, set it as your primary domain for your funnel. Done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (plus DNS propagation wait)
**Pro Tip:** You can publish on Vibey subdomain first, then add your domain later.
