## Example Conversations

### Brainstorming Lead Magnets

**You:**
> I need a lead magnet idea for my coaching offer. What would work best?

**Vibey:**
> Based on your offer (helping busy executives lose 20 lbs in 90 days), here are 3 lead magnet ideas:
>
> 1. **"The 7-Day Executive Energy Plan"** - Meal plan + workout schedule optimized for busy schedules. Low time commitment, immediate value.
>
> 2. **"20 Healthy Meals in 20 Minutes"** - Quick recipe guide for time-starved professionals. Solves the "I don't have time to cook" objection.
>
> 3. **"The Desk Workout Protocol"** - 5-minute exercises to do at office. No gym required. Addresses your "no gym" unique selling point.
>
> I'd recommend #3 if you want to emphasize your unique approach, or #2 if you want broadest appeal.
>
> Want me to write the landing page copy for one of these?

---

### Reviewing Landing Page Copy

**You:**
> Review this headline: "Get Fit Fast With My Proven System"

**Vibey:**
> This headline doesn't match your brand voice or positioning. Issues:
>
> - **"Get Fit Fast"** - Too generic, doesn't reflect your specific outcome (20 lbs in 90 days)
> - **"My Proven System"** - Weak, unspecific, doesn't highlight your unique angle (no gym needed)
> - **Tone** - Too salesy for your direct, confident brand voice
>
> Better headline options:
>
> **Option 1:** "Lose 20 Pounds in 90 Days—No Gym Required"
> - Specific outcome
> - Timeframe clear
> - Unique angle front and center
>
> **Option 2:** "Busy Executive? Drop 20 Pounds Without Setting Foot in a Gym"
> - Targets ICP directly
> - Addresses main objection (time)
> - Clear benefit
>
> **Option 3:** "20 Pounds. 90 Days. Zero Gym Visits."
> - Matches your direct, punchy brand voice
> - All key points in 6 words
>
> Which direction do you prefer?

---

### Planning a Campaign

**You:**
> I want to launch my offer next month. What should I do?

## AI Word Usage

**Free Plan:** 10,000 AI words/month
**Pro Plan:** 50,000 AI words/month
**Word Packs:** Purchase 25,000 AI words for $10 (never expires, available to all users)

### How AI Words Are Calculated

Vibey uses OpenRouter with prompt caching, which means AI words are calculated based on actual token usage:

```
AI Words = (input_tokens + output_tokens - cached_tokens) / 1000 * 750
```

**What This Means:**
- **Input tokens:** Your messages to Vibey
- **Output tokens:** Vibey's responses
- **Cached tokens:** Context that's reused from previous conversations (FREE!)
- **Conversion rate:** 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 AI words

### Caching Benefits

When you have multiple conversations about the same offer or document:

**First Conversation:**
- 5,000 input tokens + 3,000 output tokens = 8,000 tokens
- No caching yet
- **AI Words Used:** (8,000 / 1000) × 750 = **6,000 AI words**

**Second Conversation (Same Offer):**
- 5,000 input tokens + 3,000 output tokens = 8,000 tokens
- 4,000 cached tokens (offer context reused)
- **AI Words Used:** ((8,000 - 4,000) / 1000) × 750 = **3,000 AI words**

**Result:** 50% savings on AI words due to caching!

### What Counts as AI Words

**Counts:**
- Your input messages
- Vibey's responses
- Document analysis
- Template processing

**FREE (Cached):**
- Repeated offer context
- Previously analyzed documents
- Reused brand guidelines

### Tracking Usage

Check remaining AI words:
- Top right of chat interface
- Settings > Billing > Usage

**Example Display (Pro with Word Pack):**
```
Monthly AI Words: 25,342 / 50,000 (Resets Jan 1)
Word Packs: 12,500 remaining (Never expires)
Total Available: 37,158 AI words
```

**Example Display (Free):**
```
Monthly AI Words: 5,342 / 10,000 (Resets Jan 1)
Word Packs: 0 remaining
Total Available: 4,658 AI words
```

### Word Pack Priority

When you have both monthly words and purchased word packs:

**Usage Order:**
1. **Word packs used FIRST** (because they never expire)
2. **Monthly allowance used SECOND** (resets monthly)

**Example:**
- You have 10,000 monthly words + 25,000 word pack
- Use 15,000 AI words this month
- **Result:** 10,000 from word pack, 5,000 from monthly allowance
- **Next month:** 15,000 word pack remaining + fresh 10,000 monthly = 25,000 total

### Monthly Word Reset

**Resets:** 1st of every month
**Free Plan:** 10,000 AI words added
**Pro Plan:** 50,000 AI words added
**Word Packs:** Never reset, never expire

### What Happens When You Run Out

**No more AI words:** Chat stops working
**No mid-conversation cutoff:** You can finish current conversation

**Need More Words?**
- **Buy word packs:** $10 per 25,000 AI words (instant, never expires)
- **Wait for monthly reset:** 1st of each month
- **Upgrade to Pro:** 5x more monthly words (10K → 50K)

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

Generic questions = generic answers.

**Bad:** "How do I market my business?"
**Good:** "What's the best lead magnet for attracting busy executives who want to lose weight?"

### Provide Context

More detail = better responses.

**Example:**
> I'm launching a webinar next week. My offer is [offer name]. My audience is [ICP]. I want to fill 50 seats. What promotional strategy should I use?

### Ask Follow-Ups

Conversations build on each other.

**Flow:**
1. "Give me 5 headline ideas"
2. "Expand #3 into a full landing page"
3. "Make it punchier and shorter"
4. "Now write the email promoting this page"

### Use Commands

Direct Vibey to specific tasks.

**Commands:**
- "Write [X]" → Creates content
- "Review [X]" → Critiques your work
- "Explain [X]" → Teaches concept
- "Plan [X]" → Creates strategy
- "Brainstorm [X]" → Generates ideas

---

## What Vibey Chat Can't Do

### No Internet Access

Vibey doesn't browse the web.

**Can't:**
- Check current news
- Visit URLs
- Scrape competitor sites in real-time
- Access private data outside Vibey

**Can:**
- Use data from your offer (scraped during offer creation)
- General marketing knowledge (up to training date)

### No Account Actions

Vibey Chat is advisory only.

**Can't:**
- Create funnels for you
- Publish pages
- Edit offers
- Change settings

**Can:**
- Tell you how to do all those things
- Provide copy to paste into funnel builder
- Guide you step-by-step

### No Long-Term Memory (Beyond Conversation)

Each conversation is isolated.

**Remembers:**
- Current conversation context
- Selected offer data

**Doesn't Remember:**
- Past conversations (unless you reference them)
- Changes you made after last chat
- Information from other chats

**Workaround:** Start new chats with "As we discussed before, [summary]..."

---

## Privacy & Security

### Your Data

All conversations are private.

**Who Sees Your Chats:**
- You
- Vibey AI (processes responses)
- No one else

**Not Used For:**
- Training other models
- Sharing with third parties
- Marketing or ads

### Offer Data

Vibey only accesses offers you select as context.

**In Chat:**
- Only selected offer data is used
- Other offers remain private
- Switch context anytime

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Word Limit Reached"

**Cause:** Used all AI words (monthly allowance + word packs)

**Fix:**
- **Buy word packs:** $10 per 25,000 AI words (instant)
- Wait for monthly reset (1st of month)
- Upgrade to Pro for 5x monthly allowance
- Shorten responses (ask for bullet points instead of paragraphs)

### Responses Don't Match My Brand

**Cause:** Offer context not selected, or brand guidelines incomplete

**Fix:**
1. Select correct offer in context dropdown
2. Review brand guidelines (complete voice/tone section)
3. Regenerate brand guidelines if needed
4. Ask again with selected offer

### Chat Not Loading

**Cause:** Network issue or session timeout

**Fix:**
1. Refresh page
2. Check internet connection
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try different browser

### Response Cut Off Mid-Sentence

**Cause:** Response too long, hit token limit

**Fix:**
1. Ask Vibey to "continue"
2. Or ask for shorter responses: "Summarize that in 3 bullet points"
