## Best Practices

---

### Tag Consistently

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use lowercase
- Hyphens for spaces (`lead-magnet-q1`)
- Descriptive (`webinar-jan-2025` not `webinar1`)
- Organize by category (`status-hot`, `source-facebook`)

---

### Segment Before Messaging

Don't email your entire list.

**Better:**
- Segment by interest
- Target engaged contacts
- Personalize messaging

**Result:**
- Higher open rates
- Lower unsubscribes
- Better conversions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Leads Not Appearing

**Check:**
- Funnel published and live
- Form connected to CRM (should be automatic)
- Test form submission yourself

**Fix:**
1. Submit test form
2. Check CRM for test lead
3. If missing, check funnel settings
4. Contact support if persists

---

### Duplicate Contacts

**Cause:** Same person opted in multiple times (different funnels)

**Fix:**
1. Search for contact
2. Identify all duplicates
3. Merge into one record

**Prevent:** Coming auto-merge feature (Q1 2026)

---

### Export Fails

**Cause:** Too many contacts, timeout

**Fix:**
1. Filter to smaller segment
2. Export in batches
3. Try again during off-peak hours
