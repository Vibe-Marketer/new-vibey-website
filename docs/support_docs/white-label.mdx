# White-Label Agency

<Info>
**Coming in Q4 2026** - White-label features are currently in development.
</Info>

Rebrand Vibey with your agency's logo, colors, and domain. Resell as your own proprietary marketing platform to clients and charge premium rates.

## What's Coming

### Full Rebranding

Make Vibey look like your platform.

**Customizable:**
- **Logo** - Replace Vibey logo with yours
- **Colors** - Match your brand (primary, secondary, accents)

- **Company Name** - Everywhere "Vibey" appears, shows your name
- **Email Branding** - System emails sent from your domain
- **Support Links** - Point to your support instead of Vibey's

**Result:**
Clients never know they're using Vibey. They think it's your proprietary tech.
