# Team Collaboration

<Info>
**Coming in Q2 2026** - Team collaboration features are currently in development.
</Info>

Invite team members to your Vibey workspace. Assign roles, share funnels, collaborate on campaigns, and manage permissions—all from one central dashboard.

## What's Coming

### Multi-User Workspaces

Add team members to your Vibey account.

**Features:**
- Invite unlimited team members
- Each member gets their own login
- Shared access to funnels, offers, campaigns
- Centralized billing (one subscription)
- Team activity dashboard

**Use Cases:**
- Marketing agencies (collaborate with clients and team)
- In-house marketing teams
- Founders + VA/contractor
- Partners/co-founders

---

### Role-Based Permissions

Control what team members can do.

**Roles:**
- **Owner** - Full access, billing control
- **Admin** - Full access except billing
- **Editor** - Can create and edit all content
- **Viewer** - Can view but not edit
- **Contractor** - Limited access to assigned projects

**Permissions:**

### Shared Assets

Collaborate on marketing assets.

**Not Shared:**

### Real-Time Collaboration

Work together in real-time.

**Features:**

- Live cursor tracking (see teammate edits live)
- Comments and feedback on funnels
- @mentions to notify teammates
- Activity feed (who did what, when)

**Like Google Docs, but for marketing**

### Project Organization

Organize work by client or campaign.

**Projects:**
- Create projects for each client or campaign
- Assign team members to projects
- Project-specific funnels, sequences, campaigns
- Filter view by project
- Per-project analytics

**Agency Use Case:**
- Project 1: Client A (assign team members, track work)
- Project 2: Client B (separate team, separate assets)
- Internal: Your own marketing

---

### Team Analytics

Track team performance.

**Metrics:**

- Collaboration frequency

**Use Cases:**
- Identify bottlenecks
- Reward top contributors
- Balance workload

---

### Comments & Feedback

Leave feedback directly on funnels and campaigns.

**How It Works:**
1. Click anywhere in funnel editor
2. Leave comment or question
3. @mention teammate
4. They get notified
5. Reply to comment
6. Mark as resolved

**Thread Comments:**
- Full conversation history
- Attachments (screenshots, files)
- Resolve when done

## What to Do Now

While team collaboration isn't available yet:

**Workarounds:**
- **Share Login:** Multiple people use same account (not ideal for security)
- **Export/Import:** Export funnels, share with teammates, they import
- **Screen Share:** Use Loom/Zoom to collaborate async

**Best Practice:**
Wait for official team features (Q2 2026). They'll be worth it.
