## Tips for Tours

### Don't Rush

Take your time, read each step.

**Tours Are Self-Paced:**
- No time limit
- Pause anytime
- Can't fail or get wrong answer

**Better to understand than finish fast**

---

### Actually Perform Actions

Don't just click "Next" without doing the action.

**Why:**
- Learn by doing (muscle memory)
- See real results in your account
- Build confidence

**Tours Create Real Data:**
- Test offers, funnels, sequences you create during tours
- Safe to delete after tour if not needed

---

### Replay When Needed

Don't be shy about replaying tours.

**Replay If:**
- Forgot how to do something
- Feature updated with new capabilities
- Want to show teammate
- Just need a refresher

**No Judgment:** Replaying tours is smart, not a sign of failure
