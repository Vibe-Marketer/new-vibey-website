## AI Word Usage

Voice transcription uses AI words from your monthly allowance.

**How It's Calculated:**

```
AI Words = (Transcription Length in Words) × 1.2
```

**Example:**
- Speak 100 words → Uses ~120 AI words
- Speak 500 words → Uses ~600 AI words
- 1.2× multiplier accounts for processing overhead

**Why the Multiplier:**
- Audio analysis
- Noise filtering
- Punctuation inference
- Context understanding

### Checking Usage

Track AI word consumption:

**Dashboard:**
- Settings > **Billing** > **Usage**
- See total AI words remaining
- Filter by transcription vs other features

**During Recording:**
- Estimated word count shown while speaking
- Approximate AI words displayed

**Monthly Allowances:**
- **Free Plan:** 10,000 AI words/month (includes transcription)
- **Pro Plan:** 50,000 AI words/month (includes transcription)
- **Word Packs:** Purchase 25,000 AI words for $10 (never expires)

## Tips for Better Transcription

### Speak Naturally

Don't over-enunciate or talk slowly.

**Good:** Normal conversational pace
**Bad:** S-l-o-w, r-o-b-o-t-i-c speech

**Why:** AI trained on natural speech patterns

---

### Use a Quality Microphone

Built-in laptop mics work, but external mics are better.

**Options:**
- **Laptop/phone built-in mic:** Acceptable, 85-95% accuracy
- **USB microphone:** Great, 95-98% accuracy
- **Headset with boom mic:** Excellent, 95-99% accuracy
- **Airpods/wireless earbuds:** Very good, 90-95% accuracy

**Best:** Microphone close to mouth (6-12 inches)

---

### Minimize Background Noise

Find a quiet space.

**Ideal:**
- Closed room
- No TV/music playing
- No loud conversations nearby

**Acceptable:**
- Coffee shop (light ambient noise okay)
- Home office with distant sounds

**Avoid:**
- Busy streets
- Crowded restaurants
- Construction zones

---

### Say Punctuation When Needed

For complex punctuation, speak it explicitly.

**Examples:**
- "Write a blog post **comma** focus on benefits **period**"
- "What's your name **question mark**"
- "This is amazing **exclamation point**"

**Natural Pauses:** AI infers most punctuation automatically from speech rhythm

---

### Break Into Chunks

Long recordings = higher error rate.

**Best Practice:**
- Record 1-2 sentences at a time
- Stop, review, continue
- Easier to fix errors

**Avoid:**
- 5+ minute continuous recordings
- Complex run-on sentences
- No pauses between thoughts

---

### Review and Edit

Always check transcription before submitting.

**Common Errors:**
- Homophones (there/their/they're)
- Proper nouns (capitalize names)
- Technical terms (may need correction)

**Quick Review:** Read once, fix obvious errors, submit

---

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

**Cause:** Browser permissions not granted

**Fix:**
1. Click microphone icon
2. Browser shows permission prompt
3. Click **Allow** to grant access
4. Try recording again

**If Still Not Working:**
1. Check browser settings > Permissions > Microphone
2. Ensure Vibey domain is allowed
3. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Check system microphone permissions (Mac: System Preferences > Privacy > Microphone)

---

### Low Accuracy / Lots of Errors

**Cause:** Background noise, accent, or mic quality

**Fix:**
1. Move to quieter location
2. Speak closer to microphone (6-12 inches)
3. Use headset with boom mic
4. Speak slightly slower and clearer
5. Say punctuation explicitly

**Still Low Accuracy?**
- Try typing instead
- Use external USB microphone
- Check mic isn't muted or volume low

---

### Transcription Cuts Off Mid-Sentence

**Cause:** Long pause detected (auto-stop after 60 seconds of silence)

**Fix:**
1. Don't pause longer than 5-10 seconds while recording
2. Click microphone to stop manually (don't let it auto-stop)
3. Record in shorter chunks (1-2 sentences at a time)

---

### Text Appears Gibberish or Wrong Language

**Cause:** Microphone picking up wrong audio source

**Fix:**
1. Check system audio input settings
2. Select correct microphone (not speakers or line-in)
3. Close other apps using microphone (Zoom, Skype, etc.)
4. Restart browser

---

### "AI Word Limit Reached" Error

**Cause:** Used all monthly AI words

**Fix:**
1. **Buy word packs:** $10 per 25,000 AI words (instant, never expires)
2. Wait for monthly reset (1st of month)
3. Upgrade to Pro for 5× more AI words (10K → 50K/month)
4. Type instead of using voice until words refill
