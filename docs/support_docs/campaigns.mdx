---

## Troubleshooting

### Campaign Generation Fails

**Cause:** API timeout, missing offer data, server error

**Fix:**
1. Check offer is complete (all steps)
2. Click "Retry" on failed task
3. If persists, create funnel and sequence manually
4. Contact support if repeated failures

---

### Funnel Created But No Emails

**Cause:** Sequence generation task failed

**Fix:**
1. Go to Sequences
2. Create sequence manually from template
3. Use same offer for consistency
4. Connect to campaign

---

### Sequence Not Sending

**Cause:** Sequence not activated, trigger misconfigured

**Fix:**
1. Check sequence status = Active
2. Verify trigger (form submission, tag added)
3. Test trigger manually
4. Check email limits not exceeded

---

### Low Campaign Performance

**Diagnose:**
- **Low traffic** → Marketing/advertising issue
- **Low opt-in rate** → Funnel problem (headline, offer clarity)
- **Low email opens** → Subject line or deliverability issue
- **Low clicks** → Email content or CTA weakness
- **Low conversions** → Offer/price/timing issue

**Fix:** Identify bottleneck, test improvements
