## Advanced Techniques

### Chain Prompting

Use output from one prompt as input for next.

**Example:**

1. **Prompt 1:** Generate 10 headline ideas
2. **Review:** Pick best 3
3. **Prompt 2:** Expand headline #2 into full landing page
4. **Prompt 3:** Write email promoting that landing page

**Why:** Iterative refinement, better quality

---

### Few-Shot Examples

Show AI examples of desired output.

**Structure:**

```
Write ad copy like these examples:

Example 1: "Lose 20 Pounds. No Gym. 90 Days."
Example 2: "Build Your Funnel. 30 Minutes. Zero Code."
Example 3: "Scale to $10K/Month. One Tool. No Team."

Now write 5 variations for my offer: [offer details]
```

**Why:** AI matches style and structure

---

### Negative Instructions

Tell AI what NOT to do.

**Example:**

```
Write landing page headline.

DO NOT:
- Use "amazing," "incredible," "revolutionary"
- Make generic claims
- Exceed 10 words
- Use passive voice
```

**Why:** Avoid common AI clichés

---

## Limitations

### No Direct Funnel Building

The Lab generates copy, not funnels.

**Workflow:**

1. Generate copy in Lab
2. Copy output
3. Paste into funnel builder
4. Customize in visual editor

**Can't:** Build funnels directly from Lab (coming Q2 2026)

---

### No Real-Time Web Data

Lab can't browse internet or access live data.

**Has Access To:**

- Your offer documents
- Your brand guidelines
- General marketing knowledge (up to training date)

**No Access To:**

- Competitor websites (in real-time)
- Current trends
- Live market data

---

### Token Limits

Very long generations may hit limits.

**Max Output:** ~4000 tokens (~3000 words)

**Solution:** Generate in sections, then combine

---

## Prompt Library

Community-shared prompts (coming soon).

**What It Will Include:**

- Top-performing prompts from other users
- Industry-specific templates
- Tested and proven frameworks
- Ratings and reviews

**Status:** Q1 2026

---

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

More detail = better output.

**Bad:** "Write a landing page" **Good:** "Write a landing page for [offer] targeting [ICP]. Emphasize [unique benefit]. Use [tone]. Include headline, 3 bullet points, and CTA."

---

### Iterate

First output rarely perfect.

**Process:**

1. Generate initial version
2. Review, identify weaknesses
3. Refine prompt
4. Regenerate
5. Repeat until satisfied

---

### Use Context

Always connect offer or brand guidelines.

**Without Context:** Generic, forgettable copy **With Context:** Specific, on-brand, converting copy

---

### Test Variations

Generate multiple options, test which performs best.

**Example:**

- 5 headline variations
- A/B test in funnels
- Track performance
- Winner gets used everywhere

---

## Troubleshooting

### Output Is Generic

**Cause:** No context, vague prompt

**Fix:**

1. Add offer context
2. Include brand guidelines
3. Be more specific in prompt
4. Give examples of desired style

---

### Output Too Short/Long

**Cause:** Max length setting, or prompt unclear

**Fix:**

1. Adjust max length in settings
2. Specify length in prompt: "Write 500 words"
3. Use stop sequences to control length

---

### AI Ignores Instructions

**Cause:** Prompt too complex, conflicting instructions

**Fix:**

1. Simplify prompt (one task at a time)
2. Remove contradictions
3. Break into multiple prompts (chain prompting)
