  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Domain">
    Type your domain (like `example.com` or `www.example.com`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Vibey shows DNS records to add. Go to your domain provider and add them:
    - **A Record** - Points to Vibey servers
    - **CNAME Record** - For www subdomain
    - **TXT Record** - For verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Click **Verify Domain**. Verification takes 5-60 minutes depending on DNS propagation.

</Steps>

### Domain Status

- **Pending** - Just added, DNS not configured
- **Verifying** - DNS records detected, checking SSL
- **Verified** - Active and ready to use
- **Error** - DNS misconfiguration or SSL issue

### Troubleshooting Domains

**Domain stuck on "Verifying"?**
- Wait 60 minutes for DNS propagation
- Check DNS records match exactly what Vibey shows
- Clear your DNS cache

**SSL certificate not working?**
- Automatic HTTPS takes 10-15 minutes after verification
- Check domain status shows "Verified"
- Contact support if issues persist

**Can't delete domain?**
- Unassign from all funnels first
- Then go to Domains > Remove
